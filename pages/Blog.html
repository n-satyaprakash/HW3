            <h2>Quote from The Witcher Books</h2>
            <p>“Evil is evil, Stregobor. Lesser, greater, middling, it's all the same. Proportions are negotiated, boundaries blurred.” - Andrzej Sapkowski, The Last Wish</p>
            <p>"I've been forced to make many hard choices. Who to fight, who to spare, who to kill. Now I have to choose the lesser evil. Again and again. No matter what I do, it always comes back to that. And I'm tired of choosing. I just want to live, or at least die in peace." - Andrzej Sapkowski, "Blood of Elves"</p>

            "In Blaviken, Geralt slew Renfri's bandits, as well as Renfri herself, in order to save the lives of innocent villagers. However, to the general populace, it looked like Geralt attacked them out of the blue as no one knew of Renfri's plans"
